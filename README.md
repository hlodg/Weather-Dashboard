##Weather Dashboard
This weather dashboard creates a space for people to go and see the weather for a particular city. When looking at the dashboard, the user can search a city and it will return not only today's weather but the weather for multiple days. Additionally, the weather dashboard stores information in order to help users see frequently or recently searched cities to search again. 

##Challenges
When completing this project, the main challenge was using the API for open weather, it was a challenge to create latitude and longitude from the user input. In order to use the data, I needed to pass latitude and longitude as opposed to a city name. This was solved by using the right functions.
